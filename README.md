# markovstatemodel

This repository shows the demonstration of a simple Markov State Model. This is done with a background of biophysics,
though it is mostly quite general and .

The code is contained in the two files `MSM_simulation.py` and `plotting_functions.py`, while the results can be seen
in the jupyter notebook `markov_state_model.ipynb`. The notebook contains some latex equations which are not shown 
correctly when opened on github.
